Extended Deadlines

The deadlines for presenting the Lab assignments are the last week of each period according to the MDH calendar:

* Period 1: 5-9 November 2018 (please contact us to fix a date)
* Period 2: 14-18 January 2019 (please contact us to fix a date)
* Period 3: 25-29 March 2019 (please contact us to fix a date)
* Period 4: 3-7 June 2019 (please contact us to fix a date)

We encourage the students to present their work during the lab sessions during the course so that they can get our help and use the resources provided by the university. After the end of the course (i.e., after the first TEN1 instance) students will not get any help from us.
